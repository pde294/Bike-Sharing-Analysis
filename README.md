## **Summary**
 - Overalll, the mornings of Thursday-Sunday appear to be the most popular times for all riders. In regards to next steps for analysis, I would like to do visualizations on 1) trip duration between the most popular starting location-stop location pairs, and 2) bike repairs by trip duration.
